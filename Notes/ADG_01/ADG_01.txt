This is about the HSBC DataGrid project we discussed before


Background:
I work of a HSBC bank's engineering team.
I am developing datagrid common component to be used in many future projects.
These projects are mostly sponsored and used by various departments within HSBC.
These are used internally only and these departments can be in any geography where HSBC operates
Info Nextjs, Shadcn, typescript, tailwind css, Tanstack table.

Task:
Suggest me few business objects which I can in my datagrid.
For example loan object. I want my application very realistic for prospective application sponsors.
I need real world objects which are used internally in HSBC.

I will be working on this project for at least a month.
I need you to store all our conversation so that you have context about this project for at least a month.
(I am bookmarking this page, does opening this page in future helps you in recollecting conversation context )

Meanwhile I see Treasury Deal Ticket more relatable.
Please explain more about - Treasury Deal Ticket & its attribute.
Add 2 attributes - Region and Site (both as string).
Also generate a collection of 20 object of Treasury Deal Ticket.
